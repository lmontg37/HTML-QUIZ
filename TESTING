FULL ANSWER
The br tag should not be used to separate paragraphs. Instead, the paragraph HTML tag should be used, which is simply the lower-case letter p encased in brackets as well. For inserting a br tag in HTML, br followed by a space and then by a forward slash will be used inside of brackets. There is no difference in the line break tag when working with HTML 4.01 or HTML 5.
